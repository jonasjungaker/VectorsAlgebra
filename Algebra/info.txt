More vector functionality
Matrix implementation, 
  eventually merge vector and matrix functionality with vector being a 1*n matrix

Plotting library needs to support more extensive plotting functions
  standard axes needs to be implemented correctly
  need support for different axes scales: log(n), n^2 etc
